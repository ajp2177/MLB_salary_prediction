# The Business of Baseball: Predicting MLB Player Salaries Using Machine Learning

Background:

MLB organizations spend millions on signing players to long-term deals. Often, these deals extend a playerâ€™s contract for five or more years while providing large salaries with guaranteed money. Issues start to arise for organizations when players do not perform and provide less value than expected for the designated years of their contract. This costs teams money that could be put towards other players, trades, and free agents. Through regression analysis, MLB franchises can better access their player needs, money distribution, and appropriate salaries for players. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118642994/221646894-d1b2a955-88c1-4d6a-b801-564e6a1fee60.png)






This project uses Gradient Boosting Regression to predict MLB player salaries based on player performance.
